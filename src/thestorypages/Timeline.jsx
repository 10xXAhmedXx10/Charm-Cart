                <p>
                and another couple days to work on the back-end,which was a little bit more complicated than the front-end because there's logic and other things going on behind the scenes, but it wasn't a lot, which is why I was able to finish everything in a couple days.

                but for sure, that's not going to be it because I'll be updating the website and adding more features as time goes by.

                The progress was straightforward, and I'm really proud of how far the project has come from the beginning to this point.
