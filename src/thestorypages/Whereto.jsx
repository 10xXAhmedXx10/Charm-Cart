                CharmCart will continue to provide some cool new planned features, but what exactly are they?

               One of the coolest sections the website will host will be the browser-based games, and there will be at least five of them to give the user the most of what the website can offer.

                <p>
              
                and there's a lot more that will be done, like blog section, user rating, comments, and a lot more!
