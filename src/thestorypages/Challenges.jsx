                Working on CharmCart was a very enjoyable experience, but it wasn't without difficulties and challenges throughout this wonderful journey.
The biggest challenge I encountered was the specified time period for the project, so I tried to study the possibility of adding all the things that were planned for the project during this time period. Unfortunately, it was impossible to add all the sections and pages that were planned, but I managed to make the app look very nice and functional. So I am planning to add more features and functions to the site later; after graduation the journey will continue to amprove CharmCart . With the education part done, there will be more time and mental energy to dedicate to this passion project. The first step will be to make a detailed plan outlining the features and improvements that could not be added during the initial development.

                The other challenge was the debugging. As you know, there is no perfect website on the internet, and Charmcart is no exception, so I have faced a lot of bugs, some of which were easy to fix and others that took hours to figure out what line of code was causing the issue and way ?

                I am really grateful that at this time we have a bunch of resources like <span style={{fontSize: '25px', color: 'blue'}}> stack overflow, MDN </span>, and other awesome websites that we can learn from and fix any bugs that might come along with the codeing process.
